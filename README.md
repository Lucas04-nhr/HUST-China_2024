# Team HUST-China 2024 Wiki

The main language used to write wikis in this repository is `Markdown`.

This repository **MUST** contain all coding assets to generate your team's wiki
(HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, etc).

Images, photos, icons and fonts **MUST** be stored on `static.igem.wiki` using
[tools.igem.org](https://tools.igem.org), and Videos **must** be embedded
from [iGEM Video Universe](https://video.igem.org).

For up-to-date requirements, resources, help and guidance, visit
[competition.igem.org/deliverables/team-wiki](https://competition.igem.org/deliverables/team-wiki).

## Getting started

You should probably only edit the files inside folders `static`, `wiki` and
`docs`.

1. Open the Web IDE
2. Make the changes on the files you wish:
    - For the menu, change the file [menu.html](wiki/menu.html)
    - For the layout, change the file [base.html](wiki/base.html)
    - For the pages, change the corresponding file in the foler [docs](docs)
3. Review the changes you made
4. Once you are done, save the changes by **committing** them to the _main branch_ of the repository
5. An automated script will build, test and deploy your wiki, which should take
   less than 30 seconds.

## About this Template

### Files

The static assets are in the `static` directory. The layout and templates are in
the `wiki` directory, and the pages live in the `docs` directory. Unless you are
an experienced and/or adventurous human, you probably shouldn't change other
files.
