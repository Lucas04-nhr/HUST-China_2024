## Styling your wiki

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Feel free to customize the page styling according to your preferences, or you can simply leave the style as it is. It's
wise to focus on a clear content first, and on a clean design later.

Be cautious with the size of the assets like images, videos, and more, that you put in your wiki. Large file sizes can
hinder the presentation of wikis due to slow internet connections. Remember to compress large files before uploading
them to iGEM servers.

This default wiki meets the requirements, enhances navigability, and provides a user-friendly experience for visitors.
You should not feel obligated to go beyond the provided styling.

## Tips

---

This wiki will be your team's first interaction with the rest of the world, so
here are a few tips to help you get started:

- State your accomplishments! Tell people what you have achieved from the
  start.
- Be clear about what you are doing and how you plan to do this.
- You have a global audience! Consider the different backgrounds that your
  users come from.
- Make sure information is easy to find; nothing should be more than 3 clicks
  away.
- Avoid using very small fonts and low contrast colors; information should be
  easy to read.
- Start documenting your project as early as possible; don't leave anything to
  the last minute before the Wiki Freeze. For a complete list of deadlines
