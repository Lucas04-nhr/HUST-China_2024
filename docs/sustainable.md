#### Best Sustainable Development

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a call to action to integrally address global environmental, social, and
economic challenges. As the future leaders of synthetic biology research and innovation, it’s your responsibility to
participate in the global conversations to help develop solutions towards meeting the SDGs. We encourage you to
demonstrate how you have evaluated your project ideas against one or more of the SDGs, how you’ve consulted with SDG
stakeholders, and how you’ve begun to form collaborations with other iGEM teams around the SDGs. You’re encouraged to
look back at previous iGEM projects to evaluate them against the SDGs and build upon them.

To compete for the Best Sustainable Development prize, select the prize on
the [judging form](https://competition.igem.org/deliverables/judging-form) and describe your work on this page.
