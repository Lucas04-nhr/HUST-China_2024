## What should this page contain?

---

-   Include pictures of your teammates, don't forget instructors and advisors!
-   You can add a small biography or a few words from each team member, to tell
    us what you like, and what motivated you to participate in iGEM.
-   Take team pictures! Show us your school, your lab and little bit of your
    city.
-   Remember that image galleries can help you showcase many pictures while
    saving space.

**Important:** Your wiki pages will be archived at the end of the iGEM season
and this content will remain online. Please keep this in mind as you post photos
and personal information on this page.
