#### Best Measurement

Measurements are critical to scientific communication and advancement. Well-reported measurements are the only way to
show whether hardware is functioning correctly, whether data are reliable, and whether a result is actually important.
There is a high value in identifying appropriate targets for measurement, collecting precise measurements, and reporting
results clearly and with appropriate units. Document your careful measurement efforts and you could win this award!
