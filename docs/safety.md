#### Safety and Security Award

Synthetic biology will need to be used safely and securely if local people are
to solve local problems all around the world. The Safety and Security Committee
is challenging teams to apply biological engineering approaches to manage risks
associated with synthetic biology. Can you take the next step in incremental
progress towards knowledge, understanding, and tools that will make the use of
synthetic biology safer and more secure?

To compete for the Safety and Security award, please describe your work on this
page and also fill out the description on the
[judging form](https://competition.igem.org/deliverables/judging-form).

## What should this page contain?

---

On this page of your wiki, you should write about how you are addressing any
safety issues in your project. The wiki is a place where you can go beyond the
questions on the safety forms, and write about whatever safety topics are most
interesting in your project. (You do not need to copy your safety forms onto
this wiki page.)

Please visit the
[Safety Policies page](https://responsibility.igem.org/safety-policies/introduction)
to find this year's safety requirements & deadlines, and to learn about safe &
responsible research in iGEM.

## Safe Project Design

---

Does your project include any safety features? Have you made certain decisions
about the design to reduce risks? Write about them here! For example:

-   Choosing a non-pathogenic chassis
-   Choosing parts that will not harm humans / animals / plants
-   Substituting safer materials for dangerous materials in a proof-of-concept
    experiment
-   Including an "induced lethality" or "kill-switch" device

## Safe Lab Work

---

What safety procedures do you use every day in the lab? Did you perform any
unusual experiments, or face any unusual safety issues? Write about them here!
