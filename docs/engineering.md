#### Silver Medal Criterion \#1

Demonstrate engineering success in a part of your project by going through at
least one iteration of the engineering design cycle. This achievement should be
distinct from your Contribution for Bronze.

If you plan to show engineering success by creating a new Part that has been
shown to work as expected, you must document your contribution on the Part's
Main Page on the [Registry](https://parts.igem.org/Main_Page) for your team to be
eligible for this criteria.
