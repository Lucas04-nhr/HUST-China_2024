considerations and stakeholder input guide your project purpose and design and the experiments you conduct in the lab?
How does this feedback enter into the process of your work all through the iGEM competition? Document a thoughtful and
creative approach to exploring these questions and how your project evolved in the process to compete for this award!

To compete for the Best Integrated Human Practices prize, select the prize on

## Overview

---

At iGEM we believe societal considerations should be upfront and integrated
throughout the design and execution of synthetic biology projects. “Human
Practices” refers to iGEM teams' efforts to actively consider how the world
affects their work and their work affects the world. Through your Human
Practices activities, your team should demonstrate how you have thought
carefully and creatively about whether your project is responsible and good for
the world. We invite you to explore issues relating (but not limited) to the
ethics, safety, security, and sustainability of your project, and to show how
this exploration feeds back into your project purpose, design, and execution.

Please note you can compete for the Silver Medal criterion \#2 and the Best
Integrated Human Practices prize with this page.

For more information, please see the
[Human Practices Hub](https://responsibility.igem.org/human-practices/what-is-human-practices).

On this page, your team should document all of your Human Practices work and
activities. You should write about the Human Practices topics you considered in
your project, document any activities you conducted to explore these topics
(such as engaging with experts and stakeholders), describe why you took a
particular approach (including referencing any work you built upon), and explain
if and how you integrated takeaways from your Human Practices work back into
your project purpose, design and/or execution.
