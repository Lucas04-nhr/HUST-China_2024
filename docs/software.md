#### Best Software Tool

Regardless what's the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the bigger project forward.
Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can even prove
surprisingly useful for others. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a
project's success. This award tries to find and honor such "nuggets" of computational work. To be eligible, your
software has to be documented and made available under an OSI-approved open source license. Teams nominating themselves
for this prize must host the source code of their software on the dedicated repository
on [iGEM's GitLab](https://gitlab.igem.org/2024/software-tools/).

To compete for the Best Software Tool prize, select the prize on
the [judging form](https://competition.igem.org/deliverables/judging-form), host your software
on [iGEM's GitLab](https://gitlab.igem.org/2024/software-tools/), and describe your work on this page.
