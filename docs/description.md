## Some advice

---

We encourage you to put up a lot of information and content on your wiki, but we
also encourage you to include summaries as much as possible. If you think of the
sections in your project description as the sections in a publication, you
should try to be concise, accurate, and unambiguous in your achievements. Your
Project Description should include more information than your project abstract.

## References

---

iGEM teams are encouraged to record references you use during the course of your
research. They should be posted somewhere on your wiki so that judges and other
visitors can see how you thought about your project and what works inspired you.
