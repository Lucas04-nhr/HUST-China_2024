## What should this page contain?

---

- Clearly and objectively describe the results of your work.
- Future plans for the project.
- Considerations for replicating the experiments.

## Describe what your results mean

---

- Interpretation of the results obtained during your project. Don't just show
  a plot/figure/graph/other, tell us what you think the data means. This is an
  important part of your project that the judges will look for.
- Show data, but remember **all measurement and characterization data must
  also be on the Part's Main Page on the
  [Registry](https://parts.igem.org/Main_Page).** Otherwise these data will not
  be in consideration for any medals or part awards!
- Consider including an analysis summary section to discuss what your results
  mean. Judges like to read what you think your data means, beyond all the
  data you have acquired during your project.

## Project Achievements

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can also include a list of bullet points (and links) of the successes and failures you have had over your summer. It
is a quick reference page for the judges to see what you achieved during your summer.

- A list of linked bullet points of the successful results during your project
- A list of linked bullet points of the unsuccessful results during your project and what you learned from them. This is
  about being scientifically honest. If you worked on an area for a long time with no success, tell us so we know where
  you put your effort. Furthermore, you can still impress the judges by thoughtfully discussing what went wrong and how
  you might change things.
