## Introduction 

Our project aims to enable *Escherichia coli* BL21 to efficiently degrade polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG) while utilizing the EG for energy. Additionally, we seek to confer the ability to utilize TPA and produce rhamnolipid on *Pseudomonas putida* KT2440. To achieve these objectives, we primarily constructed four plasmids: pPeteg-P and pPeteg-M for *E. coli* BL21, and pTerephthalate and pRhamnolipid for *P. putida* KT2440. In addition to these four main plasmids, we also developed five additional plasmids to facilitate more convenient testing of gene functions.

We transferred these plasmids into *E. coli* BL21 and *P. putida* KT2440 to express the desired proteins. Concurrently, we conducted comprehensive investigations to validate the efficiency of PET degradation and the production efficiency of rhamnolipid.
