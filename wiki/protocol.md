      \end{aligned}
    \right.
  $$
</center>

​	(When the fragment length is longer than the plasmid, regard the fragment as the plasmid and regard the plasmid as the fragment to calculation)

  <figcaption class="caption table_caption">Table 6. Ingredients of double enzyme digestion</figcaption>

  | **Component** | **Amount** |
  | ------------- | ---------- |
  | Fragment      | 60$\mathrm{\mu L}$       |

<figcaption class="caption table_caption">Table 7. Ingredients of enzyme ligation</figcaption>

| **Component**   | **Amount** |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Fragment        | 1 $\mathrm{\mu L}$       |
| Vector          | 4 $\mathrm{\mu L}$       |
| T4 ligation mix | 5 $\mathrm{\mu L}$       |

3. Put the tube in 16 °C react for 20 min(while the 25 °C react for 10 min), transfer the system into *E. coli* DH5$\alpha$.

### Plasmid extraction

1. Take 3 mL bacteria solution to centrifugate at 12000 rpm for 1 min, and pour out the supernatant. (If the bacterial plaque is small, repeat until getting a large one.)
2. Add 250 $\mathrm{\mu L}$ solution I. Blow and stir repeatedly to ensure that there is no bacterial block to cleave the inside of the bacterial block adequately.(Components of solution I: EDTA, glucose. EDTA is the chelating agent of divalent metal. It can chelate divalent metal ions to inhibit the activity of DNase, protecting the extracted DNA from degradation. Glucose plays the role of avoiding the suspended Escherichia coli settling too quickly.)
3. Add 250 $\mathrm{\mu L}$ solution II, slowly invert, and turn the tube several times to mix gently. Stand for two minutes to get a transparent cleavage solution. In order not to break the DNA chain, the operation must be very gentle. The standing time can not be too long since DNA will also break under alkaline conditions, otherwise, the genomic DNA will be broken. It is difficult to separate broken DNA from the plasmid.(Components of solution Ⅱ: NaOH and SDS. NaOH dissolves cells and combines with protein to form the sediment. Remember to close the lid in time after using solution II because NaOH will react with carbon dioxide in the air.)
4. Add 350 $\mathrm{\mu L}$ solution III, immediately invert and mix.(Components of solution Ⅲ: potassium acetate, acetic acid. SDS encounters potassium ions to generate water-insoluble PDS, resulting in a large amount of flocculent precipitation. Since the genomic DNA is a long chain, it is easy to be precipitated by these precipitations. It is difficult to precipitate if the genomic DNA breaks into short chains. )Acetic acid is to neutralize the sodium hydroxide in the previous step.)
5. Centrifugate at 12000 rpm for 10 min.
6. Carefully pipette the supernatant into the column. Centrifugate at 12000 rpm for 1 min. Repeat once without standing.
7. Add 500 $\mathrm{\mu L}$ HBC washing Buffer, centrifugate at 12000 rpm for 1 min and discard the filtrate.
8. Add 700 $\mathrm{\mu L}$ DNA washing Buffer (80% ethanol) to clean the purification column. Centrifugate at 12000 rpm for 1 min and discard the filtrate. Repeat the wash operation twice.(Wash away impurities such as small molecular proteins and inorganic ions.)
9. Centrifugate empty column at 12000 rpm for 2 min.
10. Dry in 37 °C until the purification column is no ethanol (15 min). (Remove ethanol in these two steps, otherwise, the subsequent elution efficiency will be affected.)
11. Put the purification column into a clean 1.5 mL EP tube and add 30 $\mathrm{\mu L}$ of the ddH2O preheated at 60 °C to the center of the silicone gel membrane, and stand it for 2 min. Centrifugate at 12000 rpm for 1 min. (Preheat can improve the elution efficiency, and add it to the center of the silicone gel membrane to ensure that the eluent will completely cover the surface of the silicone membrane to achieve maximum elution efficiency.)
12. Repeat the elution with the above eluent without standing. The first standing is to let the eluent cover the silicone membrane and let the DNA fall off the column.

### *E. coli* heat shock transformation

1. Take 100 $\mathrm{\mu L}$ of the competent *E. coli* that melted on ice to the precooled 1.5 mL EP tube.
2. Add 2 $\mathrm{\mu L}$ plasmid to the tube and avoid touching the bottom of the EP tube. Then gently blow and stir and place the tube on ice for 5 min.
3. Place the tube at 42 °C for 90s and transfer it to the ice immediately to bathe for 2 min.
4. Add 700 $\mathrm{\mu L}$ non-antibiotics liquid LB to the tube and incubate it in a shaker at 37 °C for 20 min.
5. Take solid LB medium, add antibiotics and pour the plate.
6. Centrifugate at 5000 r/min for 2 min, pour out part of the supernatant, re-suspend it, spread it on a plate, and incubate it at 37 °C.

### *E. coli* conservation

Add 800 $\mathrm{\mu L}$ 50% glycerol aqueous solution to the seed preservation tube for high-pressure steam sterilization, mix with 800$\mathrm{\mu L}$ bacteria solution, and store at -20 °C.

2. Adjust the pH to around 2.0 using 6 M HCl.
3. Add an equal volume of ethyl acetate, vortex for 15-20 minutes, then centrifuge at 8000 rpm for 10 minutes.
4. Remove the organic phase and add 8 mL of ethyl acetate. Combine the organic phases from both extractions.
5. Evaporate the organic phase to obtain the rhamnolipid sample for thin-layer chromatography identification and quantification by the anthrone-sulfuric acid method.

#### Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) of rhamnolipid

1. Prepare the plate: Dissolve 0.5 g of carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (CMC-Na) in 100 mL of water, heat to boiling to dissolve, mix with the adsorbent silica gel at a ratio of 1:3 and grind evenly, then spread the gel on a glass plate, then shake it evenly. Dry the gel in the dark, and then place it in an oven at 105°C for about 30 minutes, then cool the plate and set aside.
2. Spotting samples: Take the sample to be tested, and use a micro-syringe to draw a certain amount of sample, gently touch it to the TLC plate to allow the sample to be absorbed automatically (ensuring the spot diameter does not exceed 3 mm). You can spot multiple times, and blow away any residual solvent with a wash ball before each new spot. There must be a spacing of 15 mm between two spots to avoid interference.
3. expansion: Choose an appropriate glass specimen tank based on the size of the TLC plate, and prepare the developing solvent (make sure the ratio of the developing solvent is: methanol : water : acetic acid = 65:15:12:1). Seal the glass specimen tank for 10-15 minutes to saturate the developing solvent, then place the TLC plate at an angle to immerse it for development, allowing the solvent to move up the TLC plate.
4. Visualization: After expansion, remove the TLC plate and let it dry. Spray the TLC plate with a visualizing reagent and heat for 2 min to develop the color that could indicate the presence of carbohydrate compounds. The visualizing reagent is 2 g of anthrone dissolved in 1 L of 80% sulfuric acid. Place a small amount of iodine crystals in a sealed container to saturate the air with iodine vapor, then place the TLC plate inside for a few minutes. We can see the color development which indicates the presence of lipid compounds.
5. Take a small amount of bacterial liquid, centrifuge, and use the supernatant as the sample to be tested. Compare it with a standard rhamnolipid sample in the chromatography experiment to observe color development and determine the presence of rhamnolipid compounds.

#### Quantitative detection of rhamnolipids

1. Take 400 $\mathrm{\mu L}$ of *P. putida* KT2440 (rhlA-rhlB-pVLT33) in an 1.5 mL EP tube.
2. Weigh 0.04 g of anthrone, dissolve it in 20 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid to prepare the sulfuric acid-anthrone solution. The solution must be used as soon as it has been prepared.
3. Slowly add 800 $\mathrm{\mu L}$ of sulfuric acid-anthrone solution into the 400 $\mathrm{\mu L}$ *P. putida* KT2440 solution, and incubate at 100°C for 10 min. Then cool the solution to room temperature.
4. Measure the absorbance of the solution at 625 nm by using a microplate reader.
