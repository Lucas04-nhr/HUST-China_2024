## Education

As a new science, synthetic biology has complex technology and rapid development and has great application potential in various aspects. But as our project progressed, we realized that many members of the public lacked sufficient understanding of its principles, applications, and potential societal implications, which was detrimental to the future development of synthetic biology. Therefore, we draw inspiration from Rousseau's "naturalistic" education concept, and start with the phenomena and problems in life, so that the public can better understand the scientific basis and practical application of synthetic biology, to achieve the role of "enlightening the mind".

| Target                 | Purpose                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Primary school student | Stimulate the curiosity of primary school  students to biological knowledge and enhance the drive to actively explore  and learn biological knowledge. |
| Middle school student  | Feel the scientific research atmosphere,  stimulate the interest in science, enhance the support for science and  technology, and lay the interest foundation for junior and senior high school  biology courses. |
| College student        | Arouse interest in scientific research,  deeply analyze and exchange cutting-edge knowledge of scientific research,  and guide college students to cultivate scientific research literacy and  subjective initiative in order to play a role in future scientific  innovation. |
| The public             | Enable more people to participate in  science, so that they can actively learn about synthetic biology, raise their  questions and concerns, and participate in discussions, research or practical  applications of synthetic biology. |

### Science Lecture in Wuhan Science and Technology Museum

**Science is no longer a lofty theory, but a tool that is closely related to our lives. Science does not only exist in the laboratory, but also has great potential in everyday life.** With this philosophy in mind, we had the privilege of spending a fulfilling afternoon with children aged 5 to 12 and the public at the Wuhan Science and Technology Museum on August 1, 2024. Through this event, we hope to stimulate children's curiosity, ignite their passion to explore the future, and let everyone understand how the amazing science of synthetic biology can help us solve real-world challenges."

#### Reveal the Veil of Synthetic Biology with Life Examples

We introduce common problems in life such as environmental pollution and energy shortage, and ask "Can these problems be solved by science and technology?" These questions are close to children's daily life and quickly arouse their interest and thinking. We then introduce the concept of synthetic biology in an easy-to-understand way: it is the science of designing and modifying living organisms as "engineered systems." It is like a "designer of life", by rewriting the DNA sequence, you can design microorganisms with new functions to deal with problems in many fields such as agriculture, the environment, energy, health, such as designing microorganisms that can decompose plastic, helping to solve the global plastic pollution problem. The children listened with interest, asking themselves questions from time to time: "Can these microbes really eat plastic?" Are they bad for us?" We patiently answered their questions through humorous and life-friendly language.
