## Education

As a new science, synthetic biology has complex technology and rapid development and has great application potential in various aspects. But as our project progressed, we realized that many members of the public lacked sufficient understanding of its principles, applications, and potential societal implications, which was detrimental to the future development of synthetic biology. Therefore, we draw inspiration from Rousseau's "naturalistic" education concept, and start with the phenomena and problems in life, so that the public can better understand the scientific basis and practical application of synthetic biology, to achieve the role of "enlightening the mind".

### Science Lecture in Wuhan Science and Technology Museum

**Science is no longer a lofty theory, but a tool that is closely related to our lives. Science does not only exist in the laboratory, but also has great potential in everyday life.** With this philosophy in mind, we had the privilege of spending a fulfilling afternoon with children aged 5 to 12 and the public at the Wuhan Science and Technology Museum on August 1, 2024. Through this event, we hope to stimulate children's curiosity, ignite their passion to explore the future, and let everyone understand how the amazing science of synthetic biology can help us solve real-world challenges."

#### Reveal the Veil of Synthetic Biology with Life Examples

We introduce common problems in life such as environmental pollution and energy shortage, and ask "Can these problems be solved by science and technology?" These questions are close to children's daily life and quickly arouse their interest and thinking. We then introduce the concept of synthetic biology in an easy-to-understand way: it is the science of designing and modifying living organisms as "engineered systems." It is like a "designer of life", by rewriting the DNA sequence, you can design microorganisms with new functions to deal with problems in many fields such as agriculture, the environment, energy, health, such as designing microorganisms that can decompose plastic, helping to solve the global plastic pollution problem. The children listened with interest, asking themselves questions from time to time: "Can these microbes really eat plastic?" Are they bad for us?" We patiently answered their questions through humorous and life-friendly language.

#### Interactive Session: Let's Protect the Earth with Synthetic Biology!

To help children better understand how synthetic biology can solve life's problems, we have designed an interactive mini game, as shown in Figure 1. In this session, the children are divided into teams, and each team faces a specific problem, such as "how to solve the power shortage in the city" or "how to reduce plastic pollution". Each team had to apply the basic thinking of synthetic biology, imagining that some kind of microbe or organism could be engineered to solve this problem. Through this interactive discussion and brainstorming, the children come to understand the concept of "design" in synthetic biology, realizing that by reprogramming the genes of organisms, they can be given new functions, like "programming" life.

#### Hands-on Session: Create Your Own "Synthetic Organism"

We prepared stickers with images of plasmid components such as promoters, terminators and genes. In this small game, children are like little scientists, using a virtual platform to design the plasmid they want by "assembling" different gene fragments. Each plasmid has a different function, such as enabling cells to produce electricity, produce pigments, or absorb heavy metals. Through this game experience, children not only learn the basic principle of plasmids, but also have a preliminary understanding of the concept of gene editing and molecular biology.

#### Sharing the Harvest and Enlightening the Mind

At the end of the lecture, children are encouraged to actively share what they have learned. The children said that they experienced the charm and creativity of science through participation and hands-on work. Many of the children were not satisfied, and many said: "I want to be a scientist!" Parents accompanying the children were also very impressed: "The children not only have fun, but also learn so much new knowledge, this kind of activity is really very meaningful."

### Life Farm Practice Activities

On March 12, which coincides with the International Arbor Day, an important festival for advocating green environmental protection, we invited students from the primary School affiliated to Huazhong University of Science and Technology to help them learn the importance of ecological protection in practical actions. Through visiting the herbarium, learning about the farmland ecosystem, and planting trees by hand, the whole activity runs through the understanding and care of the natural world, and the spirit of Arbor Day takes root in the hearts of children.

#### Visit the Herbarium

From insects to birds, from plants to fish, the children watched with great interest a variety of biological specimens. With our detailed explanation, the children not only learn about the classification of these creatures, their living habits and their role in the ecosystem, but also learn how they are related to human life. The vivid display in the herbarium makes the children feel as if they are in a mini ecological world, which makes them full of curiosity and yearning for the wonder of nature.

#### Laboring in Life Farm

Our Life Farm mimics an ecosystem in a field, where children not only observe common crops, but also see many small animals living in the field. We introduced the children to the importance of these small creatures in the field, especially their unique role in maintaining ecological balance and helping crops grow. After that, the children worked in groups to plant saplings themselves. Each child picked up a shovel, carefully dug, buried, watered, and carefully completed each step.

### National Youth College Science Camp

To enhance the basic knowledge of synthetic biology for middle school students, while improving their hands-on skills in the laboratory, on July 22, representatives of students from many middle schools across the country gathered to participate in a one-day synthetic biology and science camp. The event aims to give students a deeper understanding of cutting-edge biological technologies through the combination of theory and practice, while stimulating their interest in scientific research.

#### The core of synthetic biology -- microorganism

Our content revolves around synthetic biology, using examples of our exploration of synthetic biology to introduce students to the fundamental concepts, principles and applications of the discipline. Through easy-to-understand presentations, interactive Q&A sessions, and practical case studies, students learn about gene editing, which will help them better understand genetic engineering. During the presentation, the students actively participated in the discussion, showing a strong interest in the future of biotechnology.

#### Basic microbiology experiment skills training

After the explanation of theoretical knowledge, the students learned the basic operation methods of the microscope and further learned the use of oil mirrors. We also taught them bacterial and fungal techniques, including common Gram staining and water lenses. The observation session allows students to clearly see the structure of the stained microorganisms under the microscope, which brings them a new experimental experience.

### Return Visit to High School

With deep feelings for their Alma mater, members of the HUST-China team used the winter holiday to travel to different parts of the country and return to the campuses they once knew. Under the background of team project, we popularize the knowledge of synthetic biology and life science from junior students and junior students, aiming to enhance students' understanding and recognition of life science.

The team members introduced the content of the competition project to the students in plain language, and deeply discussed the relevant knowledge in the field of synthetic biology. The detailed and popular explanation enhanced students' understanding and love of life science, made students feel the atmosphere of scientific research more deeply, and thus stimulated the motivation of learning. This kind and in-depth exchange not only narrowed the distance between students and science, but also laid a solid foundation for their future learning and exploration.

### When Cultural Heritage Meets Synthetic Biology

On the evening of June 8th, coincident with the Chinese Cultural Heritage Day, we innovatively linked cultural heritage with synthetic biology for students of different majors in our university. While popularizing the knowledge related to synthetic biology for students, we also called on everyone to pay attention to the protection and inheritance of cultural heritage by the relevant role of synthetic biology in the protection of cultural heritage. And experience the cultural skills of innovation and development enabled by biotechnology. In this event, we also invited members from the HZAU-China team to feel the charm of intangible cultural heritage together.

#### How can synthetic biology empower cultural heritage?

We took the Dunhuang Mogao Grottoes, which may be submerged in yellow sand due to oxidation and other problems, as an example to draw students' attention to the protection of world cultural heritage. Then, the paper listed the relevant solutions and problems in the current protection of cultural heritage, and discussed with the students the possibility of better application of relevant technologies in the protection of cultural heritage based on the cutting-edge progress of synthetic biology. In addition, we also introduce the research and application of HUST-China in related technologies. The unconstrained nature of synthetic biology aroused great interest of the students.

#### Intangible cultural heritage experience

We have selected two biologically related intangible cultural heritage for students to experience. Team members detailed their origins, links to biology, and methods of operation. The students give full play to their teamwork ability and aesthetic ability, cooperate with each other, color change and blend, with a great sense of life and randomness, half artificial, half natural, open different picture scrolls, the beauty is between the similar and the different.

### Synthetic Biology and Orienteering

On April 4th, during the Qingming Festival, we had an in-depth exchange with our friends from HZAU-China and organized a unique science popularization activity of synthetic biology on the campus of Huazhong Agricultural University.

#### The original of synthetic biology

Considering that the students have a certain genetic engineering foundation in middle school, we explained to them a series of operational processes such as the extraction of target genes, the construction of gene expression vectors, the introduction of target genes into recipient cells and the subsequent detection and identification of these target genes and focused on the composition of the "machine" plasmid. To provide a concrete example of the application of synthetic biology, we presented the iGEM project to the audience.

{% include figure.html image="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5175/resources/education/education-11.jpg" alt=" " caption="Fig 11. Explaining the components of synthetic biology" %}

#### Orienteering

Partners from HZAU-China crafted keyrings containing cartoon images of plasmid components such as promoters and terminators and placed them in various corners of the campus in advance, waiting for students to explore. While roaming the campus in the bright spring light of April, the students thought about what other components belonging to the plasmid had not yet been obtained. This deepened the students' understanding of plasmids.

### Communication with Evry Paris-Saclay iGEM team

On July 12, 2024, we communicated closely with the captain and core members of the Evry-Paris-Saclay team through the Sino-French Exchange Summer Camp wine tasting, sharing our ideas and discussing the details of the project.

#### Importance of project target specificity

Evry Paris-Saclay's team plans to induce targeted mutations in protein genes that bind to PHA to improve the specific recognition of plastic particles of PHA. This led us to realize that any iGEM project is designed to solve a real problem, so the project needs to be precise and adaptable in order to increase the social value of turning ideas into real outputs.

#### Significance of visualized results

Through the panels of the Evry Paris-Saclay team, we recognized the importance and appeal of "visualizing" project results within a limited time frame.

### Actively participate in CCiC exchange meetings
