## Education

As a new science, synthetic biology has complex technology and rapid development and has great application potential in various aspects. But as our project progressed, we realized that many members of the public lacked sufficient understanding of its principles, applications, and potential societal implications, which was detrimental to the future development of synthetic biology. Therefore, we draw inspiration from Rousseau's "naturalistic" education concept, and start with the phenomena and problems in life, so that the public can better understand the scientific basis and practical application of synthetic biology, to achieve the role of "enlightening the mind".

| Target                 | Purpose                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Primary school student | Stimulate the curiosity of primary school  students to biological knowledge and enhance the drive to actively explore  and learn biological knowledge. |
| Middle school student  | Feel the scientific research atmosphere,  stimulate the interest in science, enhance the support for science and  technology, and lay the interest foundation for junior and senior high school  biology courses. |
| College student        | Arouse interest in scientific research,  deeply analyze and exchange cutting-edge knowledge of scientific research,  and guide college students to cultivate scientific research literacy and  subjective initiative in order to play a role in future scientific  innovation. |
| The public             | Enable more people to participate in  science, so that they can actively learn about synthetic biology, raise their  questions and concerns, and participate in discussions, research or practical  applications of synthetic biology. |
