## Background

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the agricultural industry chain consumes 12.5 million tons of plastic products and 37.3 million tons of food packaging annually. Experts predict that due to the increasing demand for greenhouses, plastic films, and silage films, the use of plastics in the agricultural sector will grow by 50% or even higher in the coming years.Approximately 300 million acres of land in Asia need to be covered with 1.45 million tons of plastic film each year, accounting for 75% of the global film usage[^1]. 

The large-scale use of plastics has brought about great harm in the dark - microplastic pollution. Microplastics(MP) refer to plastic fragments and particles with a diameter of less than 5 millimeters, which are a diverse and non-uniform mixture of plastic particles that are difficult to distinguish by the naked eye. A large amount of agricultural plastic residue can lead to the accumulation of high concentrations of microplastics in farmland soil. Research has shown that microplastics can alter soil properties, affecting environmental conditions such as soil aggregate structure and porosity by altering soil bulk density and water holding capacity[^2]. Changes in soil porosity and water holding capacity may affect oxygen content, thereby altering the diversity and distribution of both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms, and disrupting crop growth. Microplastics can significantly alter soil carbon storage in farmland, affecting nitrogen and phosphorus cycling as well as microbial activity[^3].

The presence of microplastics in soil can also affect plant growth, interfere with plant metabolic processes, such as causing oxidative stress, increasing the bioavailability and toxicity of heavy metals in plants, reducing soil bulk density, and thus reducing yield and crop quality. And plastic in the form of nanoparticles (<100 nm) can be absorbed by roots and transferred to aboveground plant parts, becoming an important source of microplastic in food[^4].

At present, the treatment methods for microplastics are mainly divided into three categories: physical separation, chemical degradation, and biodegradation. Physical separation mainly separates microplastics from other substances through screening, filtration, and other methods. The operation is simple, but the removal efficiency is low, making it difficult to remove nanoscale microplastics. Chemical degradation uses chemical reagents to further decompose microplastics into small molecules under specific conditions, but the cost of using the chemicals is high, and improper use may also cause secondary pollution to the environment. Biodegradation is the use of microorganisms or enzymes to degrade microplastics into gases, water, and harmless substances for living organisms. Biodegradation has a relatively small impact on the environment and is widely used in the treatment of microplastics in soil and water bodies. It has the potential to develop efficient, low-cost, and low side effect methods for removing environmental microplastics.
