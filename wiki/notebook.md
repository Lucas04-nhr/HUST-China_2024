- Perform double enzyme digestion on the plasmids tphA2A3BA1-pUC57 and tpaK-pBBR1-CS2 (vector). However, we found that the length of the band obtained by double enzyme digestion of tpaK-pBBR1-CS2 (vector) is too short.

We suspect that due to the wrong designing of our plasmid, the tpaK gene fragment contained the restriction enzyme sites that would cut the gene fragment tpak into two pieces while we're performing double enzyme digestion on plasmid tpak-pBBR1CS-2, resulting in an excess of wrong fragments with identical cohesive ends, which would ultimately causes most ligation products to be incorrect.

We believe that the similar lengths of the rhlA-rhlB fragment and the pUC57 fragment make it difficult to clearly separate bands during electrophoresis, preventing precise purification of the rhlA-rhlB gene fragment.

- Obtain the rhlA-rhlB gene fragment through PCR from the plasmid rhlA-rhlB-pUC57 and purify the recovered fragment.

- Transform the plasmid (ligation) into *E. coli* DH5$\alpha$ and culture overnight.
- Pick bacterial plaque, PCR bacterial fluid, and verify by agarose gel electrophoresis. 

We failed to link these fragments. We suspect that the low activity and amplification efficiency of the pVLT33 (vector) plasmid resulted in low ligation efficiency between pVLT33 and phaZ. We decide to proceed the expression validation for other plasmids first, and continue to construct plasmid phaZ-pVLT33 if our experiment schedule is relatively free.
